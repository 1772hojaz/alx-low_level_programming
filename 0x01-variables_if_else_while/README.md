Low-level programming refers to programming languages that provide little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture
1
. These languages are "close to the hardware" and require knowledge of the processor's instructions and orientation within the relationships of internal systems or related devices
3
. Low-level programming languages can convert to machine code without a compiler or interpreter, and the resulting code runs directly on the processor
1
. Programs written in low-level languages tend to be relatively non-portable, due to being optimized for a certain type of system architecture
1
.
Low-level programming is still used in IoT and wearables/hardware, where the amount of energy a device uses is important
2
. Learning low-level programming can be useful for those interested in writing device drivers, fast calculation libraries, and operating system kernels
3
.
Some advantages of low-level programming include the ability to adapt the processor to specific needs and requirements, offering more control over the device
3
. Programs written in low-level languages can be made to run very quickly, with a small memory footprint
1
. However, low-level languages are considered difficult to use, due to numerous technical details that the programmer must remember
1
.
The only true low-level programming languages are Assembly and Machine Code
2
. C is considered a low-level or "intermediary" language
2
. Python and JavaScript are examples of high-level languages
