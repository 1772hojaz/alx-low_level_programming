**Types and memory**

char - 1 byte
int - 4 bytes
float - 4 byte


# the size of a type determines how many values a variable of the type hold

when we declare a variable, the computer will reserve the right amout of space for the variable in the memory(depending on the type) .

The space reserved for the variable is its address


char c ;
here i have just declared the variable c of type char

when a value is assigned to our variable, then it is store to the variable's address. thus it is stored at char c address
so the ascii value will be  stored in c's address not literaly the letter eg 'H', 'S'

so chars are onlys stored as 1 byte

and int is 4 bytes thus 32bits (8X4)
